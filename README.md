# Movie Recommendation System
# Project Description

This project is a content-based movie recommendation system built using the TMDB (The Movie Database) dataset. It suggests movies to users based on the similarity of content (overview, genre, keywords, etc.) with the movie they like. The model uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to compare movie metadata and deliver relevant recommendations.
